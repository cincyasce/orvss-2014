      <p>Communities such as Cincinnati are reclaiming their lost rivers and waterfronts to address environmental concerns, changing flood elevations, and to provide revitalized green space for city centers. As professionals in the geotechnical field, we are being asked to evaluate existing flood defenses and water retention structures and to provide sustainable design and construction services in areas with high water tables and rapid drawdown concerns.</p>
      <p>The 45<sup>th</sup> Ohio River Valley Soil Seminar (ORVSS XLV) will address geotechnical aspects of waterfront development including geotechnical design, instrumentation, exploration, construction and case histories. ORVSS XLV will highlight the evolution of levee safety, pressure relief well assessment and design, scour protection, landslide repair along waterfronts, waterfront protection, riverfront development design and construction, rapid drawdown, and levee repair.</p>
      <p>ORVSS XLV will provide Geotechnical Engineers, Geologists, Contractors, Material Suppliers, and other geotechnical practitioners an opportunity to share experiences on previous projects in the geotechnical aspects of waterfront development to continue the advancement of our professional field.</p>
