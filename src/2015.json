        "The 46th Ohio River Valley Soils Seminar (ORVSS XLVI) will address grouting techniques and design methods employing these applications. Grouting is a versatile and effective solution which can be used to achieve a diverse range of objectives for many geotechnical issues encountered in civil engineering works.  For geotechnical and geology professionals, grouting is an important aspect of temporary works, including seepage and groundwater control, ground improvement, foundation support and many other geotechnical applications.",
        "ORVSS XLVI will provide Geotechnical Engineers, Geologists, Contractors, Material Suppliers, and other geotechnical practitioners an opportunity to share innovative applications of grouting techniques to continue the advancement of our knowledge in this field."
